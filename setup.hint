ldesc: "LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in concept. 
Instead of assembling molecules you create figures out of marbles. 
Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If a marble starts to 
move it will not stop until it hits a wall or another marble. To make it 
more interesting there are obstacles like one-way streets, crumbling 
walls and portals."
